# Development Log
This log is the overall meeting notes for FA 21 final project

- - - -
## November 1st ~ 7th
### Nov 6th 
We have discussed regarding team contract. The contract include two parts:
1. Common communication issues such as meeting frequency, positive communication of ideas, requests for assistance, and how to ensure the environment is inclusive 

2. Common collaboration issues including work distribution, complications handling, expected time commitment for each member each week, and potential solutions for conflicts. 

### Nov 7th 
We have worked on the project proposal about how to graphically represent the different taxonomic groups on Earth and the species that they contain. We also have worked on where to get the dataset and what each node will represent. We have decided to use three algorithms which are BFS, Dijkstra's Algorithm, and Brandes Algorithm. We have discussed about the timeline of the final project.

## November 8th ~ 14th
### Nov 11th 
We have worked on the job assignments. 

- Read/Write File - Carlos Paredes

- FindNode, FindParent - Connor Schick 

- DistanceBetween, LowestCommonGrouping - Jeff Shin 

- FindMostConnected - Jack Stubenvoll

### Nov 14th
Carlos Paredes has brought up that the issue of the current data is massive, which is over 2 million dataset. Therefore, we have decided to work on only the animalia, which decreases the number of the dataset to 1 million. 

Jeff Shin also has brought up the current problem to solve, which is regarding the Dijsktra's algorithm for finding the shortest distance between two nodes.

## November 15th ~ 21st
### Nov 20th
Jack Stubenvoll has brought up the main issue regarding the makefile and main function. We had to work on the makefile and main function for the whole code to be properly working. Set up for the makefile and main function was planned

## November 22nd ~ 28th
### Nov 27th
Jeff Shin has finished the findDistance and lowestCommonAncestor. Jeff Shin has mentioned that he should commit and push both functions once when the readFile / writeFile is over.

## November 29th ~ December 5th
### Dec 3rd 
Mid Point Check-in was held. TA Chris Zhu emphasized the importance of the test case to be set up and the importance of getting all the functions together.

### Dec 5th 
Connor Schick has brought up the current problem in the FindNode function. Our team has discussed Connor's current code and discussed the potential solution and things that we have to check before running the code.

## December 6th ~ December 13th
### Dec 6th
Carlos Paredes has brought up the issue with readFile, we had to look into makefile and main function first before working on the readfile. We had successfully use the makefile and main function and fixed the problem of the readfile. 

### Dec 8th
We had kept working on the part of readFile / writeFile, which was working on few errors that are shown via the compiler. After solving the errors, we have started combining the functions that Jack, Connor, and Jeff have worked on - findNode, findDistance, lowestCommonAncestor, and mostConnected. 

### Dec 11th 
We have decided to move all the functions into one TreeMkr file. Since, multiple people have worked on one device while screen sharing in the grainger library. We have started to put all the functions into the TreeMkr file. All the group members were working on the code either on their device or with collaboration in a certain person's device. 

### Dec 12th 
We have encountered a problem in Makefile and the main function is not correctly running. We have made adjustments in the makefile to get the code to compile. The next problem we encountered was that the tree is not building properly, and solved via fixing the index. Since we have the tree correctly built, we have tested our functions that we built individually. findMostConnected, findNode, and lowestCommonAncestor had a few minor errors which were resolved immediately. findDistance took longer than expected, but we have made all the functions to execute the desired function. We have pseudo tested via executing the desired value in the print statement. 

### Dec 13th
Since the functions are correctly compiling and executing the desired value, we have moved on to make test cases. We have debugged and fully tested the implementations of algorithms via choosing a couple inputs from the dataset and check if it executes the expected output. We have encountered the issue in the make test command, but it was resolved after modifying the MakeFile. Since then, we have finalized all the required paperwork and presentation. We have created the video via Microsoft screen recording and uploaded on Youtube.
