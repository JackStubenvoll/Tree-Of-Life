Communication 
1. Team Meetings-Our team will meet once a week in the file room of our chapter house. Jackts2 will take notes for each meeting. Notes will be stored on a Google document, time-stamped for each meeting. The note-taker is also responsible for drafting the weekly DEVELOPMENT LOG entry, which is approved by the team at the start of the following week’s meeting. 
2. Assistance-Each team member can be contacted through email, Discord, Snapchat, Text Message, or in person. Outside of emergencies or other commitments, we commit to responding within 48 hours. 
3. Respect- The ‘project lead’ for the weekly meeting will rotate between each member, starting with cschick3. Their role is to ensure that every member of the group has had a chance to speak or state their opinion about a design decision or any other topic related to the final project. All decisions will be accepted by simple majority – while unanimous agreement is preferred, it is not required. By signing this document, each member of the team commits to adhering to the decisions made, even if they personally disagree with them. 
Collaboration 
1. Work Distribution-Each week, the necessary deliverables for the week will be determined by the full team and each member will volunteer to work on one or more deliverables. When no one volunteers, two team members will be randomly assigned to work on the task as a paired-programming team. If this leads to an unbalanced workload for the week, adjustments can be made on a case by case basis. 
2. Time Commitment-To ensure an equal distribution of work, each member is expected to independently work no less than two and no more than six hours per week on the project. If a deliverable ends up taking more time, the rest of the team should be pulled in to assist with the unforeseen complication, with each member taking an equal share of the workload or programming in pairs. It is the team’s responsibility, not the individual’s responsibility, to make sure a weekly deliverable is finished by the end of the week. 
However if a team member is habitually not completing their tasks, they may be asked – politely – to explain their circumstances. Based on their explanation further actions, such as alerting a staff member, may be taken on a case by case basis decided by the other team members. 
3. Conflict Resolution-All conflicts within the team will be decided by a Super Smash Bros match, Omega Form, 3 stock no items. The winner will decide who was right and who was wrong. Carter Pobloske is not allowed to join in.
