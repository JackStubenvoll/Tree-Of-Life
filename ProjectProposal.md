Leading Question:Our group wishes to graphically represent the different taxonomic groups on Earth and the species that they contain. Using this graphical representation, we can determine the relatedness of two species by examining the distance between their nodes in the graph. We can also determine the smallest taxonomic grouping that two species share using this graph. This graph will be more of a general search/education tool as opposed to solving a specific problem.
Dataset Acquisition and Processing:
https://www.catalogueoflife.org/data/download
This dataset represents a list of all species on earth. We used the TextTree download, as it comes pre-sorted into a tree structure, allowing us to more easily parse the text file into a tree. We store the raw data in a text file as that is what it comes in, but we can save the tree structure into different text files that store the children of a given node to split the data into smaller sets in order to improve runtime.
Graph Algorithms: One algorithm that works for this dataset and what we are trying to do with it is Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm. As we are looking for the shortest path between two species, this works perfectly. For this algorithm, we will take in two species as the input and will output the number of edges between them. Another algorithm we would implement is a standard BFS, as if a user only has a species name to search for and no other information, then we effectively have to do a linear search on our data. However, in our find function we will provide the option for the search to include other taxonomic data to allow the user to cut down on runtime. The other complex algorithm we will use will be determining strongly connected nodes. Since each non-leaf node will have a vector containing a list of all that nodeâ€™s children, we can use the size of that vector as the number of connections it has, allowing us to examine the biodiversity of certain branches of the tree of life.
Timeline:
Order of tasks:
	Data Acquisition has already been completed
	Tree Construction will occur first. (first half of time allotted)
	Tree Structure will contain nodes with values for:
	Level of Tree (kingdom, phylum, order, etc)
	Name (Animalia, Homo, Sapiens, etc)
	writeToFile
	readFromFile
	Vector containing a list of all children of the node
Implementation of Tree Function / Complex Algorithms (second half of time allotted):
	findNode (given level and name, return node)
	findParent (returns the parent Node of a Node)
	distanceBetween (returns number of edges between 2 nodes)
	lowestCommonGrouping (returns most specific node containing both inputs)
	findMostConnected (finds the most connected descendant of the input Node)
